    <h2>Partial Differentiation</h2>
    <!-- SM358: A.8.3.1 -->

    <p>If \( f(x,t) \) is a function of the two independent variables \( x \) and \( t \), we can differentiate \( f(x,t) \) with respect to \( x \) while treating \( t \) as a constant. The result of this differentiation is called the <strong>partial derivative</strong> of \( f \) with respect to \( x \), and is written as \( \partial f / \partial x \). Similarly, we can differentiate \( f(x,t) \) with respect to \( t \) while treating \( x \)  as a constant; this gives the partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( t \), written as \( \partial f / \partial t \). Partial derivatives can be evaluated for functions of any number of variables (not just two); each partial derivative is obtained by differentiating the function with respect to one of its variables while keeping <em>all</em> the other variables constant.</p>

    <p>The partial derivatives \( \partial f / \partial x \) and \( \partial f / \partial t \) are called <strong>first-order partial derivatives</strong> because they involve a single partial differentiation. These partial derivatives are themselves functions of \( x \) and \( t \), so they can be partially differentiated again. For a function of two independent variables, \( f(x,t) \), there are four <strong>second-order partial derivatives</strong>: \[ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right), \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \right), \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \right), \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t \partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right). \] However, for well-behaved functions it turns out that the sequence of partial differentiation is irrelevant: \[ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t \partial x}, \] so, in practice, only three of the second-order partial derivatives are independent.</p>
