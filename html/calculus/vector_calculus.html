<!--
If f(x,t) is a function of the two independent variables x and t, we can
differentiate f(x,t) with respect to x while treating t as a constant. The result of
this differentiation is called the partial derivative of f with respect to x, and is
written as @f/@x. Similarly, we can differentiate f(x,t) with respect to t while
treating x as a constant; this gives the partial derivative of f with respect to t,
written as @f/@t.
