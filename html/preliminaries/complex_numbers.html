    <h1>Complex Numbers</h1>
    <!-- SM358: A.8.1 -->

    <p>A <strong>complex number</strong> can be written in the form \[ z = x + iy, \] where \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \) and \( i \) is a special quantity with the property \( i^2 = -1 \). Complex numbers of the form \( iy \) are called <strong>imaginary numbers</strong>. Real numbers are also special cases of complex numbers, with y = 0.</p>

    <p>Each complex number \( z = x + iy \) has a <strong>real part</strong>, \( Re(z) = x \), and an <strong>imaginary part</strong>, \( Im(z) = y \). Two complex numbers \( z \) and \( w \) are equal if, and only if, \( Re(z) = Re(w) \) and \( Im(z) = Im(w) \).</p>

    <p>We also define the <strong>modulus</strong> of a complex number \( z = iy \) to be \[ |z| = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 }, \] which is a real, non-negative quantity.</p>

    <h2>The arithmetic of complex numbers</h2>
    <!-- SM358: A.8.1.1 -->

    <p>Two complex numbers are <strong>added</strong> by seperately adding their real and imaginary parts, that is \[ z + w = (x + iy) + ( u + iv) = (x + u) + i(y + v). \]</p><!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Addition_and_subtraction -->

    <p>The distributive and commutative properties (of addition and multiplication) apply to complex numbers, so it follows that <strong>multiplication</strong> is performed as \[ zw = (x + iy) (u + iv) = (xu - yv) + i(xv + yu). \]</p><!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Multiplication_and_square -->

    <!-- TODO: reciprocal? -->

    <p>The <strong>quotient</strong> of any two complex numbers can be found in a similar way \[ \frac{z}{w} = \frac{x + iy}{u + iv} = \frac{x + iy}{u + iv} \frac{u - iv}{u - iv} = \frac{xu + yv}{u^2 + v^2} + i \frac{yu - xv}{u^2 + v^2} \]</p>

    <h2>Complex Conjugation</h2>
    <!-- SM358: A.8.1.2 -->

    <p>The <strong>complex conjugate</strong> of a complex number \( z = x + iy \) is the complex number z obtained by reversing the sign of i. Thus, \[ z^* = x - iy. \] More generally, the complex conjugate of any expression involving complex numbers is obtained by reversing the sign of i throughout the expression, or equivalently, by replacing each part of the expression by its complex conjugate. This means, for example, that \[ \left( a + \frac{bc}{d} \right) ^* = a^* + \frac{b^*c^*}{d^*}. \] Two successive sign-reversals have no net effect, so we always have \[ (z^*)^* = z. \]</p>

    <p>Complex conjugates are useful in finding the real and imaginary parts of complex expressions. Since \[ z = Re(z) + i Im(z) \text{ and } z^* = Re(z) - i Im(z), \] we have \[ Re(z) = \frac{z + z^*}{2} \text{ and } Im(z) = \frac{z - z^*}{2i}. \]</p>

    <p>These equations provide useful tests for whether complex expressions are real or imaginary. If an expression \( z \) is real, it has \( Im(z) = 0\), and is characterized by \( z^* = z \). By contrast, an imaginary expression has \( Re(z) = 0 \), and is characterized by \( z^* = -z \).</p>

    <p>We also have \[ zz^* = (x + iy)(x - iy) = x^2 + y^2 = |z|^2, \] so the modulus of any complex expression \( z \) is given by \( |z| = \sqrt{zz^*} \).</p>

    <h2> The geometry of complex numbers</h2>
    <!-- SM358: A.8.1.3 -->

    <p>In geometric terms, the complex number \( x + iy \) is represented by a point with Cartesian coordinates \( (x, y) \), and the plane consisting of all such points is called the <strong>complex plane</strong> or the <strong>Argand diagram</strong>. In this plane, the x-axis, which contains only real numbers, is called the <strong>real axis</strong>, and the y-axis, which contains only <strong>imaginary numbers</strong>, is called the imaginary axis.</p>

    <p>The geometric relationships linking a complex number \( z = x + iy \), its complex conjugate \( z^* \), and the complex numbers \( -z \) and \( -z^* \) are shown in figure below on the left. The operations of adding and subtracting complex numbers can also be visualized geometrically. Two complex numbers \( z \) and \( w \) are represented by the points shown in figure below on the right. Their sum is represented by the point marked \( z + w \) at the corner of the blue parallelogram, while their difference is equal to the sum of \( z \) and \( -w \) and so is represented by the point marked \( z - w \) at the corner of the red parallelogram.</p>

    <p>So far, we have specified points in the complex plane by their Cartesian coordinates \( (x, y) \), and the corresponding complex numbers written as \( x + iy \) are then said to be in <strong>Cartesian form</strong>. However, we can also specify points in the complex plane by the polar coordinates \( r \) and \( \theta \). Anticlockwise rotations increase the value of \( \theta \), while clockwise rotations decrease it. Then, values of \( \theta \) that differ by \( 2 \pi \) are equivalent in that they refer to the same point in the complex plane. We have \[ x = r cos(\theta) \text{ and } y = r sin(\theta), \] so any complex number can be written in the <strong>polar form</strong>: \[ z = r (cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta)). \]</p>

    <p>The radial coordinate is given by \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is the modulus of the complex number. The angular coordinate \( \theta \) is called the <strong>phase</strong>, or sometimes the <strong>argument</strong>, of the complex number.</p>

    <h2>Euler’s formula and exponential form</h2>
    <!-- SM358: A.8.1.4 -->

    <p>There is yet another way of expressing complex numbers, using <strong>Euler's Formula</strong>: \[ e^{i \theta} = cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta). \]Combining Euler’s formula with the polar form, we see that any complex number can be written in the form \[ z = r e^{i \theta}, \] where \( r \) is the radial coordinate (the modulus) of the complex number, and \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate (the phase). A complex number written in this way is said to be in <strong>exponential form</strong>.</p><!-- TODO: derivation of Euler's Formula -->

    <!-- SM358: A.8.1.5 -->

    <p>Although the Cartesian form is useful for adding and subtracting complex numbers, other operations are most easily carried out using the exponential form.</p>

    <p>To form the <strong>product</strong> of two complex numbers, we multiply their moduli andadd their phases: \[ z_1 z_2 = r_1 e^{i \theta_1} r_2 e^{i \theta_2} = r_1 r_2 e^{i \theta_1 + \theta_2}. \]</p>

    <p>To form the complex <strong>conjugate</strong> of a complex number we keep the modulus unchanged and change the sign of the phase: \[ z^* = (r e^{i \theta})^* =  r e^{-i \theta} \]</p>

    <!-- TODO: reciprocal? -->

    <p>To form the <strong>quotient</strong> of two complex numbers, we divide their moduli and subtract their phases: \[ \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{r_1 e^{i \theta_1}}{r_2 e^{i \theta_2}} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} e^{i (\theta_1 - \theta_2)}. \]</p>

    <p>The figure below on the left shows the geometric effect of multiplying one complex number by another; multiplying \( w \) by \( z = r e^{i \theta} \) causes stretching by a factor of \( r \) and rotation through an angle of \( \theta \). Similarly, the figure below on the right shows the geometric effect of dividing one complex number by another; dividing by \( w \) by \( z = r e^{i \theta} \) causes stretching by a factor of \( 1/r \) and rotation through an angle of \( \theta \).</p>

    <!-- SM358: A.8.1.6 -->

    <p>\[ z^n = (r e^{i \theta})^n = r^n e^{i n \theta} \text{, } n \in \mathbb{Z}. \]</p>
